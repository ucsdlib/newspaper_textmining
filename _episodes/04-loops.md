### Writing a Loop

**Loops** are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing (and typing mistakes).
Suppose we have several hundred document files named `project_1825.doc`, `project_1863.doc`, `XML_project.doc`and so on.
We would like to change these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies
`backup_project_1825.doc` and so on.

We can use a **loop** to do that.
Here's a simple example that creates a backup copy of four text files in turn.

Let's first create those files:

~~~
$ touch a.doc b.doc c.doc d.doc
~~~
This will create four empty files with those names. It is easy to use the shell to create a batch of files in one go.

Now we will use a loop to create a backup version of those files. Accordingly, we enter:

~~~
$ for filename in *.doc
> do
>    echo $filename
>    cp $filename backup_$filename
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
a.doc
b.doc
c.doc
d.doc
~~~
{: .output}

When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing `in` a list.
For each iteration,
the name of each thing is sequentially assigned to
the **variable** and the commands inside the loop are executed before moving on to
the next thing in the list.
Inside the loop,
we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.
The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat
the **variable** as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command.

In this example, the list is four filenames: 'a.doc', 'b.doc', 'c.doc', and 'd.doc'
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`
and run the `cp` command.
The first time through the loop,
`$filename` is `a.doc`.
The interpreter runs the command `cp` on `a.doc`,
and then prints the filename to the screen (because we asked it to echo each filename as it works its way through the loop).
For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes
`b.doc`. This time, the shell runs `cp` on `b.doc`
and then prints the filename to the screen. The loop performs the same operations for `c.doc` and then for `d.doc` and then, since
the list only included these four items, the shell exits the `for` loop at that point.

> ## Follow the Prompt
>
> The shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were
> typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind

> can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.
{: .callout}

> ## Same Symbols, Different Meanings
>
> Here we see `>` being used a shell prompt, but `>` can also be
> used to redirect output from a command (i.e. send it somewhere else, such as to a file, instead of displaying the output in the terminal) ---
> we'll use redirection in [episode 2]({{page.root}}/05-counting-mining).
> Similarly, `$` is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier,
> it is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.
>
> If the *shell* prints `>` or `$` then it expects you to type something,
> and the symbol is a prompt.
>
> If *you* type `>` or `$` yourself, it is an instruction from you that
> the shell to redirect output or get the value of a variable.
{: .callout}

We have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called.

This is our first look at loops. We will run another loop in the
[Counting and Mining with the Shell]({{page.root}}/05-counting-mining) episode.
