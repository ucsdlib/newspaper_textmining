# Text analysis for everyone: exploring student newspapers with computational methods  

### A workshop series hosted by the UC San Diego Library

*(In progress!!!)*

Computational methods offer exciting opportunities for exploring large textual datasets and generating insights not possible through human reading alone. These methods, however, can often seem inaccessible to students and scholars working in the humanities or qualitative social sciences, or to those with little background in programming or computational analysis. 

This workshop series aims to train participants in a variety of tools and methods that will help them apply computational forms of analysis to large textual datasets in their own research. Throughout the workshop we will be applying these methods to a collective project for the purpose of creating and sharing new knowledge with the campus community and the broader public. Our lessons will focus on computationally analyzing the The UC San Diego student newspaper collection, comprised of 2,915 issues of *The UCSD Guardian* printed from 1967 to 2014, and archived by The Library's Special Collections. By working collaboratively on a public-facing project, we hope to generate new discussions about student culture and UC San Diego history and about the value of computational methods for this research. 

To help us understand the possibility of these methods, we will review interesting (and sometimes concerning) text analysis projects happening across disciplines and industries. We will also critically discuss intellectual, political, and ethical issues related to text mining to help us sensitively consider future projects. At the end of the workshop, participants will post brief summaries and visualizations of their findings on the project website and consider what future activities might be useful for this work. 

## Text analysis for everyone toolkit

Students will learn basic skills in the following tools: 

* the shell / command line / terminal (for managing and processing files)
* Voyant (a browser based text analysis tool) 
* Python (for more complicated and larger forms of text analysis) 

## Logistics

The first instantiation of this series will consist of five consecutive workshops over the course of the Fall 2018 academic term. No prep work or homework is required. 

## Workshop Schedule

### Workshop 1

* Introducing text mining, its histories, debates, projects, and tools
* Introducing our dataset, *The Guardian* student newspaper
* Preliminary hands on text mining with Voyant
* Introducing our programming environment

### Workshop 2

### Workshop 3

### Workshop 4

### Workshop 5
